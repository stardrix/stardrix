# 🌌 Stardrix

This is not just a GitHub space. It is a quiet command center where systems meet precision, identity meets control, and automation becomes second nature.

## 🧠 Who I Am

I operate where support meets strategy and identity becomes governance. A specialist in IT infrastructure and identity automation, not just fixing issues, but shaping how access, control, and systems are structured.

I work in environments where clarity and control matter, translating complex platforms into stable and repeatable outcomes.

**Primary platforms**

## 🧩 What This Space Represents

This repository reflects a mindset rather than a checklist.

- Scripts that remove friction
- Tools that bring structure to identity sprawl
- Concepts that improve operational clarity

Everything here exists for a reason.

## 🤔 Still Figuring It Out

I am still deciding whether this GitHub is primarily for serious work driven tooling, experimental learning, or simply a playground where curiosity and profession overlap. That uncertainty is intentional.
