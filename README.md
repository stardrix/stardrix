# 🌌 Stardrix

This isn’t just a GitHub space. It’s a quiet command center where systems meet precision, identity meets control, and automation becomes second nature.

## 🧠 Who I Am

I operate where support meets strategy and identity becomes governance. A specialist in IT infrastructure and identity automation — not just fixing things, but shaping how they are controlled, accessed, and secured.

I work in environments where clarity and control are paramount, translating complex systems into consistent outcomes that just work.
